## What is TypeScript

- A JavaScript Superset
- Language building up on JavaScript
- Add new Features + Advantages to JavaScript
- Browser CAN'T execute it
- Features are compiled to JS "workarounds", possible errors are thrown

### Why TypeScript

Consider this example

```JavaScript
function add(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2;
}

console.log(add('2', '3'));
```

This is a unwanted behavior at runtime, we have a mitigation strategies in JS, that to add if check to add function validate & sanitize user input, but developers can still write invalid code. With TS we have a 'tool' that helps developer write better code.
