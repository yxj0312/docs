### Dependency Injection

#### Definition

[Dependency Injection: Huh?](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/dependency-injection-huh--net-26903)

- Dependency injection
Dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on.
- Dependency/Service/Client
These other objects are called dependencies. In the typical "using" relationship the receiving object is called a client and the passed (that is, "injected") object is called a service.
"Dependency Injection is where components are given their dependencies through their constructors, methods, or directly into fields."
