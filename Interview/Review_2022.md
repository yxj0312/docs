### Dependency Injection

#### Definition

[Dependency Injection: Huh?](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/dependency-injection-huh--net-26903)

- Dependency injection
  
    Dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on.

- Dependency/Service/Client
  
    These other objects are called dependencies.

    In the typical "using" relationship the receiving object is called a client and the passed (that is, "injected") object is called a service.

    "Dependency Injection is where components are given their dependencies through their constructors, methods, or directly into fields."

- Ioc: Inversion of Control (IoC) / Container
  
    Solution: Inversion of Control (IoC), to create a container class that will handle the brunt of the work for us.

- Laravel Service Container
  
  The Laravel service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection. Dependency injection is a fancy phrase that essentially means this: class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods.
