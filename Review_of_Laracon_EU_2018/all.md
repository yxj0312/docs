### Build bridges, not wallsâ€”Design for users across cultures (:star::star::star:)

- taiwan borned girl talked about culture difference, intesting, less useful for my job.
- lots of fun things about culture difference, for example:
    - German:
        1. Trust logos from trustshops.de
        2. Reviews from German customers
        3. German customers in roster
        4. Accepted payment methods
        5. Company description in footer
    - Chinese
        1. Typing Chinese takes a long time and finding the precise word isn't easy
        2. Search sucks, so optimize for browsing
      

## 10:30 - 11:05:
### Zero to API with Lumen (:star::star::star:)

- very basic, short speech
- if you are new to lumen, or if you have no idea what is an api, you should watch this video
- some notes:
    
    - Routing difference between laravel and lumen
    
    ```php
        // Laravel Routing
        Route::get('/', function(){
            return view('welcome');
        });
        
        // Lumen Routing
        $router->get('/', function() use($router) {
            return $router->app->version();
        })
    ```
    - Differences in Artisan
        - No 'serve' command
        - No 'key:generate'
        - No 'tinker'
        - No 'env'
        - No 'down'
        - No 'vendor:publish'
        - Only has 'make:migration' and 'make:seeder'
        - No 'make:model'
        - No 'make:controller'
        - No 'make:auth' + scaffolding 
            - AuthServiceProvider provided(uncommented in app.php)
            - JWT
            - Authentication middleware like 
            ```php
            $router->group(['middleware' => 'jwt.auth'],function() use($router){
            ....
            })
            ```
        - Many more since Lumen is slimmed down
    
- some good examples about how to write apis:

    there are apis example about pokemon, which are very clearly sturctured, could be useful for our work
