### Build bridges, not wallsâ€”Design for users across cultures (:star::star::star:)

- taiwan borned girl talked about culture difference, intesting, less useful for my job.
- lots of fun things about culture difference, for example:
    - German:
        1. Trust logos from trustshops.de
        2. Reviews from German customers
        3. German customers in roster
        4. Accepted payment methods
        5. Company description in footer
    - Chinese
        1. Typing Chinese takes a long time and finding the precise word isn't easy
        2. Search sucks, so optimize for browsing
      

## 10:30 - 11:05:
### Zero to API with Lumen (:star::star::star:)

- very basic, short speech
- if you are new to lumen, or if you have no idea what is an api, you should watch this video
- some notes:
    
    - Routing difference between laravel and lumen
    
    ```php
        // Laravel Routing
        Route::get('/', function(){
            return view('welcome');
        });
        
        // Lumen Routing
        $router->get('/', function() use($router) {
            return $router->app->version();
        })
    ```
    - Differences in Artisan
        - No 'serve' command
        - No 'key:generate'
        - No 'tinker'
        - No 'env'
        - No 'down'
        - No 'vendor:publish'
        - Only has 'make:migration' and 'make:seeder'
        - No 'make:model'
        - No 'make:controller'
        - No 'make:auth' + scaffolding 
            - AuthServiceProvider provided(uncommented in app.php)
            - JWT
            - Authentication middleware like 
            ```php
            $router->group(['middleware' => 'jwt.auth'],function() use($router){
            ....
            })
            ```
        - Many more since Lumen is slimmed down
    
- some good examples about how to write apis:

    there are apis example about pokemon, which are very clearly sturctured, could be useful for our work
    

## 11:50 - 12:40:
### Twelve-Factor Apps (:star::star::star:)

- very useful principles
- some of them I do not quite unstand, need to watch the record again
- some notes(not all):
    - One codebase for one application
    - If it only exists in production, it doesn't exist at all
    - Git commit your vendor directory -> :scream:
    - Bake system/PHP libraries into your server/Docker image
    - Strict separation from code
    - .env file considered harmful (very intersting, should see!)
        - Simple solutions:
            1. Store your config encrypted in cloud storage
            2. Download on deployment
            3. For each variable, export into enviroment
            4. Run your app
            5. Example:
            ```php
               #!/user/bin/env bash
               aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/config-vars config-vars
               export $(cat config-vars | xargs) && php -fpm
            ```
        - Better solutions:
            - AWS Secrets / Parameter Store(SSM)
            - Kubernetes Secrets
            - Hashicorp Vault
            - Heroku Config
    - If you care about your data, use managed database hosting

### Migrating a 15 Year Old Enterprise Application to Laravel: Lessons Learned and Opportunities Gained (:star::star:)

- actually not talking about lesson learned, just talking about 'jokes' earned
- lots of talks are about how laravel is good for long time maintance
- good example of enterprise workflow
- jebaited :(
- some notes:
    - use laravel caching
    - laravel security(list some laravel security features here, meaningless for this topic, I think)
    - tell us, they use ciclecl to run npm install/phpunit/jest after commiting of github (which also useless, and many other productions can also do these things)
    - they use aws and saucelabs, which is good :sleepy:
    - introduce their products, which are less related with this topic
