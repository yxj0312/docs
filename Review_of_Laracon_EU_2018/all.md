### Build bridges, not wallsâ€”Design for users across cultures (:star::star::star:)

- taiwan borned girl talked about culture difference, intesting, less useful for my job.
- lots of fun things about culture difference, for example:
    - German:
        1. Trust logos from trustshops.de
        2. Reviews from German customers
        3. German customers in roster
        4. Accepted payment methods
        5. Company description in footer
    - Chinese
        1. Typing Chinese takes a long time and finding the precise word isn't easy
        2. Search sucks, so optimize for browsing
      

## 10:30 - 11:05:
### Zero to API with Lumen (:star::star::star:)

- very basic, short speech
- if you are new to lumen, or if you have no idea what is an api, you should watch this video
- some notes:
    
    - Routing difference between laravel and lumen
    
    ```php
        // Laravel Routing
        Route::get('/', function(){
            return view('welcome');
        });
        
        // Lumen Routing
        $router->get('/', function() use($router) {
            return $router->app->version();
        })
    ```
    - Differences in Artisan
        - No 'serve' command
        - No 'key:generate'
        - No 'tinker'
        - No 'env'
        - No 'down'
        - No 'vendor:publish'
        - Only has 'make:migration' and 'make:seeder'
        - No 'make:model'
        - No 'make:controller'
        - No 'make:auth' + scaffolding 
            - AuthServiceProvider provided(uncommented in app.php)
            - JWT
            - Authentication middleware like 
            ```php
            $router->group(['middleware' => 'jwt.auth'],function() use($router){
            ....
            })
            ```
        - Many more since Lumen is slimmed down
    
- some good examples about how to write apis:

    there are apis example about pokemon, which are very clearly sturctured, could be useful for our work
    

## 11:50 - 12:40:
### Twelve-Factor Apps (:star::star::star:)

- very useful principles
- some of them I do not quite unstand, need to watch the record again
- some notes(not all):
    - One codebase for one application
    - If it only exists in production, it doesn't exist at all
    - Git commit your vendor directory -> :scream:
    - Bake system/PHP libraries into your server/Docker image
    - Strict separation from code
    - .env file considered harmful (very intersting, should see!)
        - Simple solutions:
            1. Store your config encrypted in cloud storage
            2. Download on deployment
            3. For each variable, export into enviroment
            4. Run your app
            5. Example:
            ```php
               #!/user/bin/env bash
               aws s3 cp s3://my-bucket/config-vars config-vars
               export $(cat config-vars | xargs) && php -fpm
            ```
        - Better solutions:
            - AWS Secrets / Parameter Store(SSM)
            - Kubernetes Secrets
            - Hashicorp Vault
            - Heroku Config
    - If you care about your data, use managed database hosting
            
            

## 13:40 - 14:40:
### Migrating a 15 Year Old Enterprise Application to Laravel: Lessons Learned and Opportunities Gained (:star::star:)

- actually not talking about lesson learned, just talking about 'jokes' earned
- lots of talks are about how laravel is good for long time maintance
- good example of enterprise workflow
- jebaited :(
- some notes:
    - use laravel caching
    - laravel security(list some laravel security features here, meaningless for this topic, I think)
    - tell us, they use ciclecl to run npm install/phpunit/jest after commiting of github (which also useless, and many other productions can also do these things)
    - they use aws and saucelabs, which is good :sleepy:
    - introduce their products, which are less related with this topic
    



## 14:40 - 15:30:

### 5 [fun] ways to fall in love [again] with code (:star:)

- only watch this if u can't sleep well
- try to be fun, but actually very boring
- and extremly long (15 minutes overtime)
- christopher should read those actor's lines, which are written in the slides and belongs to him. But he didn't, and made that girl a little bit nervous :D

### Fundamentally Flawed: Privacy, People and the Age of Data (:star::star::star::star:)

- 2nd best of the day
- talk about importance of privacy, data security
- some notes:
    - Data breach procedure
        1. Take down everything
        2. Export & isolate all avilable backups
        3. Identify affected users and affected data
        4. Contact affected users via bulk emial API
        5. Reset all affected users' passwords for safety
    - Watch for unitended data access
    - "Public" is ambiguous
        - Private...only me: Hashed password
        - Private...me + employee with DB access: Email address
        - Public...me + explicit whitelist: Shared files
        - Public...me + implicit whitelist: Online status
        - Public...entire web: Public post
        - Public.. entire web + bots: Public API
    - What should we do:
        - Have a protocol for self-harming behavior
        - Let me log out from other devices
        - Do usability testing to find hidden data leaks
        - Write a saner privacy policy document
        - Have a security audit
        - Audit your dependencies.You rely on them
        - Purge old employees, keys and users

## 10:30 - 11:20:
### Things every developer absolutely, positively needs to know about database indexing (:star::star::star::star::star:)

- best of the day or maybe best speech I've ever seen
- best slides, less and concise words, beautiful font, 
- perfect live coding (must see)
- humor
- focus on little things, not just talk in generalities
- some notes:
    - No sliver bullet:
    Indexing makes reading faster, but writing slower  

## 11:50 -  12:40
### Crypto for Everyone (:star::star:)

- master of php
- more like a professer, giving a lecture

### Laravel Design Patterns (:star::star::star::star:)

- I know him! the guy always been seen at laracast community

### Advanced animations with Vue.js: taking your interface to the next level(:star::star::star:)

### SOLID Design Principles (:star::star::star::star:)

- very good examples
- 3nd best speech of the day
- some notes:
    - The purpose of SOLID design principles
        - To make the code more maintainable
        - To make it eaiser to quickly extend the system with new funcionality without braking the existing ones
        - To make the code easier to read and uderstand, thus spend less time figuring out what it does and more time acutally developing the solution
        - Introduced by Robert Martin (Uncle Bob), named by Michael Feathers

## 17:00 - 17:40
### State of Laravel (:star::star::star:)

- really really short
- talks some new features of Laravel 5.7, like customizing the pagniation
- talks some features of nova, also not so much
- In his tweet, just before the speech began, he answered someones' questions, that there will not going to be laravel 6 next year, unless
    - PHP 7.3 has big changes/new feature
    - Laravel 5.11 is not good, so Laravel 5 will end at Laravel 5.10
- ~At the first day, when I took a picture with Taylot, I asked him, will his speech take a long time like the one in Laracon US this year.
And he answered, no, just 45 minutes.
