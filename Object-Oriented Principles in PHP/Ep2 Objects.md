# Objects

> If a class is the blueprint, then an object is an instance (or implementation) of that blueprint. In this lesson, you'll learn how to create multiple instances of a class, how to define and set internal state, and how to declare static constructors that better reflect how you might speak in real life.

```php
<?php

class Team
{
    public function name()
    {
        
    }

    public function members()
    {
        
    }

    public function add()
    {
        
    }

    public function cancel()
    {
        
    }
}
```
