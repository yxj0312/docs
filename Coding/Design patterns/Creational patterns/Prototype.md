# Prototype
Also known as: Clone

## Intent
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

Prototype Design Pattern
 Problem
Say you have an object, and you want to create an exact copy of it. How would you do it? First, you have to create a new object of the same class. Then you have to go through all the fields of the original object and copy their values over to the new object.

Nice! But there’s a catch. Not all objects can be copied that way because some of the object’s fields may be private and not visible from outside of the object itself.

What can go wrong when copying things “from the outside"?” width=
Copying an object “from the outside” isn’t always possible.

There’s one more problem with the direct approach. Since you have to know the object’s class to create a duplicate, your code becomes dependent on that class. If the extra dependency doesn’t scare you, there’s another catch. Sometimes you only know the interface that the object follows, but not its concrete class, when, for example, a parameter in a method accepts any objects that follow some interface.
