- In app.js, there is no reference of vue or any javascript framework
- In package.json, no vue
- In L5, out of the box we include asset/css and js, in L6 not anymore(u need to do it manually after type npm install and npm run dev)
- No more php artisan make:auth command, all of it has been removed to a laravel/ui package
- ```composer require laravel/ui php artisan ui vue --auth```
- Then you have all dependencies you have in L5
