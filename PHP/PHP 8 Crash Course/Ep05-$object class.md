# $object::class

> This next one is a small, but useful addition to PHP 8 that received unanimous support during the voting stage. You now have the ability to use ::class directly on an object. The result will be functionally identical to the result of get_class(). In PHP 7 and below, this functionality was limited to the class, itself.
