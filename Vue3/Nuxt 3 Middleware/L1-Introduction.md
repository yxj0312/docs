# Introduction

Welcome to our Nuxt 3 Middleware course! My name is Ben Hong, Vue Core Team member and Nuxt Ambassador, and I’m excited to be on this journey with you.

In this course, we’ll be learning about the fundamentals of middleware, exploring its various types and uses. By the end, you’ll be well-equipped to handle authentication, redirection, and custom logic like a pro.
