# Performance considerations

While middleware can play a vital role in our Nuxt 3 applications, it is crucial to be aware of the potential performance challenges that may arise and how we can mitigate them.

## Inefficient middleware execution

First, let’s talk about inefficient middleware execution. We must be careful about the order and the number of middleware we use, as well as how they are implemented. Executing too many middleware or placing them inefficiently in the chain can significantly impact the overall performance of our application. Therefore, always ensure that you only include the necessary middleware, and be mindful of its placement in the execution order.

## Blocking operations

Secondly, we need to address blocking operations. Middleware functions are executed sequentially, and if one middleware includes time-consuming or blocking tasks, it can delay the entire chain of execution. To mitigate this, consider using asynchronous functions and avoid CPU-intensive tasks in middleware. Promises and async/await can be valuable tools to help with this issue.

## Overuse of third-party middleware

Another common concern is the overuse of third-party middleware. While it may be tempting to rely on external libraries to handle various tasks, some of these packages may have performance drawbacks or contain unused functionality. As a best practice, always vet the packages you include in your application, and when possible, consider writing custom middleware that specifically addresses your needs, ensuring both better performance and cleaner code.

## Make sure to measure your performance

As always, whenever possible, it’s essential to monitor and measure the performance of your middleware regularly. Leveraging profiling tools can help you identify performance bottlenecks and pinpoint areas that may require optimization.
