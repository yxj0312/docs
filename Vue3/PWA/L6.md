# Fetching a Database with IndexedDB

## Creating Your First Database

```javaScript
window.indexedDB.open('alphaDb', 1)
```

Remember how we learned that IndexedDB is a native part of the browser? This means that we can access it directly via the window object in the console! Once we’ve done that, we’ll be calling the open method on IndexedDB which starts a request.

## What is a request?

A request is what we are asking from IndexedDB. What are we requesting exactly? Well, we’re requesting to open a database within IndexedDB! If one does not exist yet, it will create one. Otherwise, it will fetch us the instance that we requested.

One thing you might have noticed when we call the open function is that it takes two arguments: (1) the name of the database, and (2) the version of the database.

For the purpose of this lesson, you can assume that all our databases will be version 1. In the event you want to upgrade existing databases, this is when versions will come into play.

Now that you know how to create databases, go ahead and create gammaDb for practice. Once you’ve done that, it’s time for us to learn the next step of our journey, using lifecycle hooks to add additional requests to the database.

## What are request lifecycle hooks?

Similar to how Vue component have lifecycle hooks (e.g., mounted, created, etc.), database requests also have their own lifecycle hooks. For this lesson, we will be focusing on two primary ones: onerror and onsuccess.
