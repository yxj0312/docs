# Fetching a Database with IndexedDB

## Creating Your First Database

```javaScript
window.indexedDB.open('alphaDb', 1)
```

Remember how we learned that IndexedDB is a native part of the browser? This means that we can access it directly via the window object in the console! Once we’ve done that, we’ll be calling the open method on IndexedDB which starts a request.
