# Lesson 1 [What are progressive web apps?](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/progressive-web-apps-vue-3/what-are-progressive-web-apps)

While web apps are a powerful, popular solution for reaching your users, what happens when you need a mobile app? Rather than having to rewrite your entire app with a mobile language like Swift or Kotlin, what if we could leverage our existing work and allow users to install our web app like a mobile app?

Well, with a technology known as progressive web apps, you can!

## What are the benefits?

Progressive web apps (PWAs) are founded on the idea that web applications should have an app-like experience. There are three primary benefits:

1. __Ability to install it locally:__ Web apps used to be limited to users remembering the URL or bookmarking it, but now users can add your app to their mobile deviceâ€™s home screen like any other app.
2. __Users can use your app offline:__ Web apps also used to be bound by whether a user was connected to the internet, but with PWAs, this is no longer a limitation.
3. __Ease of access:__ As long as users have a modern browser, they are able to install your app without being restricted by the app store marketplace.

In addition, there are also features that allow you to leverage things like:

- Offline storage
- Push notifications
