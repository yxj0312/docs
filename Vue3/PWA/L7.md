# Object Stores with IndexedDB

## What are object stores?

Within a database, object stores are specific tables that contain different types of data based on whatever you define. For example, if we had a “grocery” database, you could contain all of the items in a single “product” store. On the other hand, you might want multiple object stores like “produce,” “bakery,” “drinks,” etc."

In the case of our app, we’ll keep things simple. Since our database is “todomvc,” this means that we’ll have an object store of “todos.” With that decided, it’s time to create our object store!
