# Object Stores with IndexedDB

## What are object stores?

Within a database, object stores are specific tables that contain different types of data based on whatever you define. For example, if we had a “grocery” database, you could contain all of the items in a single “product” store. On the other hand, you might want multiple object stores like “produce,” “bakery,” “drinks,” etc."

In the case of our app, we’ll keep things simple. Since our database is “todomvc,” this means that we’ll have an object store of “todos.” With that decided, it’s time to create our object store!

## When should object stores be created?

When a database is created, we will leverage an additional lifecycle hook called onupgradeneeded. Though the naming doesn’t make this immediately obvious, this lifecycle hook is called when the database is initially created or upgraded to a new version, which makes it the perfect lifecycle hook to create our object store.

```javaScript
request.onupgradeneeded = event => {
  let database = event.target.result
  // Where we will create our object store
}
```

## How to create an object store?

Inside of the onupgradeneeded hook, we’ll call the createObjectStore method on our database to initiate the transaction.

```javaScript
request.onupgradeneeded = event => {
  let database = event.target.result
  database.createObjectStore()
}
```
