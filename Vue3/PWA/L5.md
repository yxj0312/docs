# Offline Databases with IndexedDB

## What is IndexedDB?

Officially speaking, IndexedDB is a “NoSQL storage system.” And while this might make sense for people with backend experience, for this course, we’ll be assuming that you have no background knowledge of databases to keep things as simple as possible.

So, once again from the top, IndexedDB (i.e., Indexed Database), is essentially a native database that is built-in to the browser. What this means is that it allows you store data, get data, and update data as you need!

## How does it relate to PWAs?

Since Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are powered by browser technology, IndexedDB is one of the most common solutions for managing offline data since it is built right into the platform!

## The Basic Anatomy of an IndexedDB Database

At a high level, an IndexedDB database consists of three main parts:

- Database - Which in this case is called todomvcdb
- Object Store - Which essentially contains our data which are JavaScript objects. In the example above, our todomvcdb database has a single object store called todos. And in case you’re wondering, a database can have multiple object stores!
- Transaction - This is what we call the actions we take with the database (i.e., getting data, saving data, etc.) which we’ll dive into more in future lessons
