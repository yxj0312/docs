## Reading Source Code with Evan You

- [createGetter in baseHandlers.ts](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next/blob/master/packages/reactivity/src/baseHandlers.ts#L37)

createGetter has a readonly version and shallow version.

Read-only allows you to create a read-only reactive object that can be read and tracked, but you cannot mutate it.

Shallow means, when you set an object into another object as a nested property, it doesn't try to convert it into reacted one.

Inside the get, first thing here is __arrayInstrumentation__:

When you have an reactive array, when you access something nested inside of it, what you get is a reactive version of the raw data.

(rare, edge case)
for example

```javaScript
const obj = {}
const arr = reactive([{}])

const reactiveObj = arr[0]

// it will be false
obj === reactiveObj

// problem above, is when you, it return -1
// -1
arr.indexOf(obj)
```
