# [Vue 3 Reactivity](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue-3-reactivity/vue3-reactivity/)

## Q & A with Evan You

After learning how reactivity was written in Vue 2 and then in Vue 3 I was left with a couple of questions. Luckily, I had an opportunity to sit down with Evan You, the author of Vue, and ask him in person.

Questions we cover include:

- In Vue 2 Reactivity we used depend and notify for recording and playing back effects, and in Vue 3 we use track and trigger, why the change?
