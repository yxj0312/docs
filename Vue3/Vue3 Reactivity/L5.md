# [Vue 3 Reactivity](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue-3-reactivity/vue3-reactivity/)

## Q & A with Evan You

After learning how reactivity was written in Vue 2 and then in Vue 3 I was left with a couple of questions. Luckily, I had an opportunity to sit down with Evan You, the author of Vue, and ask him in person.

Questions we cover include:

- In Vue 2 Reactivity we used depend and notify for recording and playing back effects, and in Vue 3 we use track and trigger, why the change?

The bigger difference is when you name them depend and notify, depend and notify are verbs that is related to an owner, and that owner is a dependency instance. So you say a dependency instance is being depended upon or it is notifying the subscribers.

Whereas, in Vue3, we change to the implementation of dependency a bit. There's no longer a dependency class. And the logic inside the dependency notifier now extracted into just two stand-alone functions.

They are more like tracking something instead of something being depended on

- In Vue 2 Reactivity Dep is a class with subscribers, and in Vue 3 dep is simply a Set. Why the change?

vue2

```javaScript
class Dep {
    constructor() {
        this.subscribers = [];
    }

    depend() {
        if (target && !this.subscribers.includes(target)) {
            this.subscribers.push(target)
        }
    }

    notify() {
        this.subscribers.forEach(sub => sub())
    }
}
```

vue3

```javaScript
let dep = new Set()
```
