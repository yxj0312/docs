## Lesson 2 Proxy and Reflect

> In our last lesson we learned how Vue 3 keeps track of effects to re-run them when needed. However, we’re still having to manually call track and trigger. In this lesson we’ll learn how to use Reflect and Proxy to call them automatically.

### How to intercept Get and Set

- In Vue 2
  We used ES5 Object.defineProperty()

- In Vue 3
  We will use ES6 Reflect and Proxy

### Solution: Hooking onto Get and Set

#### Understanding ES6 Reflect

```javaScript
let product = { price: 5, quantity: 2}
```

There are three ways to print out a property on an object

```javaScript
// Dot notation
console.log('quantity is ' + product.quantity)

// Bracket notation
console.log('quantity is ' + product['quantity'])

// Reflect
console.log('quantity is ' + Reflect.get(product, 'quantity'))
```

### Understanding ES6 Proxy

A Proxy is a placeholder for another object, which by default delegates to the object. So if I run the following code:

```javaScript
let product = { price: 5, quantity: 2 }
let proxiedProduct = new Proxy(product, {})
console.log(proxiedProduct.quantity)
```

The proxiedProduct delegates to the product which returns 2 as the quantity. Notice the second argument on Proxy with {}? This is called a handler and can be used to define custom behavior on the proxy object, like intercepting get and set calls. These interceptor methods are called **traps** and here’s how we would set a get trap on our handler:

```javaScript
let product = { price: 5, quantity: 2 }

let proxiedProduct = new Proxy(product, {
  get() {
    console.log('Get was called')
    return 'Not the value'
  }
})

console.log(proxiedProduct.quantity)
```

A trap allows us to intercept fundamental operations (property lookup, Enumeration, Function invocation)

In the console I’d see:

Get was called

Not the value

We’ve re-written what get returns when the property value is accessed. We should probably return the actual value, which we can do like:

```javaScript
let product = { price: 5, quantity: 2 }

let proxiedProduct = new Proxy(product, {
  get(target, key) {  // <--- The target (our object) and key (the property name)
    console.log('Get was called with key = ' + key)
    return target[key]
  }
})

console.log(proxiedProduct.quantity)
```

Notice that the get function has two parameters, both the target which is our object (product) and the key we are trying to get, which in this case is quantity. Now we see:

Get was called with key = quantity

2

This is also where we can use Reflect and add an additional argument to it.

```javaScript
let product = { price: 5, quantity: 2 }
let proxiedProduct = new Proxy(product, {
  get(target, key, receiver) {  // <--- notice the receiver
    console.log('Get was called with key = ' + key)
    return Reflect.get(target, key, receiver) // <----
  }
})
```

Notice our get has an additional parameter called receiver which we’re sending as an argument into Reflect.get. This __ensures that the proper value of this is used when our object has inherited values / functions from another object.__ This is why we always use Reflect inside of a Proxy, so we can keep the original behavior we are customizing.

Now let’s add a setter method, there shouldn’t be any big surprises here:

```javaScript
let product = { price: 5, quantity: 2 }

let proxiedProduct = new Proxy(product, {
  get(target, key, receiver) {  
    console.log('Get was called with key = ' + key)
    return Reflect.get(target, key, receiver) 
  }
  set(target, key, value, receiver) {
    console.log('Set was called with key = ' + key + ' and value = ' + value)
    return Reflect.set(target, key, value, receiver)
  }
})

proxiedProduct.quantity = 4
console.log(proxiedProduct.quantity)
```

Notice that set looks very similar to get except that it’s using Reflect.set which receives the value to set the target (product). Our output as expected is:

Set was called with key = quantity and value = 4

Get was called with key = quantity

4

There’s another way we can encapsulate this code, which is what you see in the Vue 3 source code. First, we’ll wrap this proxying code in a reactive function which returns the proxy, which should look familiar if you’ve played with the Vue 3 Composition API. Then we’ll declare our handler with it’s traps separately and send them into our proxy.

```javaScript
function reactive(target) {
  const handler = {
    get(target, key, receiver) {
      console.log('Get was called with key = ' + key)
      return Reflect.get(target, key, receiver)
    },
    set(target, key, value, receiver) {
      console.log('Set was called with key = ' + key + ' and value = ' + value)
      return Reflect.set(target, key, value, receiver)
    }
  }
  return new Proxy(target, handler)
}

let product = reactive({ price: 5, quantity: 2 }) // <-- Returns a proxy object
product.quantity = 4
console.log(product.quantity)
```

This would return the same as above, but now we can easily create multiple reactive objects.

### Combining Proxy + Effect Storage

If we take the code we have for creating reactive objects, and remember:

GET property => We need to track the current effect

SET property => We need to trigger any tracked dependencies (effects) for this property

We can start to imagine where we need to call track and trigger with the code above:

```javaScript
function reactive(target) {
  const handler = {
    get(target, key, receiver) {
      let result = Reflect.get(target, key, receiver)
        // Track
      return result
    },
    set(target, key, value, receiver) {
      let oldValue = target[key]
      let result = Reflect.set(target, key, value, receiver)
      if (result && oldValue != value) { // Only if the value changes 
        // Trigger
      } 
      return result
    }
  }
  return new Proxy(target, handler)
}
```

Now let’s put the two pieces of code together:

```javaScript
const targetMap = new WeakMap() // targetMap stores the effects that each object should re-run when it's updated
function track(target, key) {
  // We need to make sure this effect is being tracked.
  let depsMap = targetMap.get(target) // Get the current depsMap for this target
  if (!depsMap) {
    // There is no map.
    targetMap.set(target, (depsMap = new Map())) // Create one
  }
  let dep = depsMap.get(key) // Get the current dependencies (effects) that need to be run when this is set
  if (!dep) {
    // There is no dependencies (effects)
    depsMap.set(key, (dep = new Set())) // Create a new Set
  }
  dep.add(effect) // Add effect to dependency map
}
function trigger(target, key) {
  const depsMap = targetMap.get(target) // Does this object have any properties that have dependencies (effects)
  if (!depsMap) {
    return
  }
  let dep = depsMap.get(key) // If there are dependencies (effects) associated with this
  if (dep) {
    dep.forEach(effect => {
      // run them all
      effect()
    })
  }
}

function reactive(target) {
  const handler = {
    get(target, key, receiver) {
      let result = Reflect.get(target, key, receiver)
      track(target, key) // If this reactive property (target) is GET inside then track the effect to rerun on SET
      return result
    },
    set(target, key, value, receiver) {
      let oldValue = target[key]
      let result = Reflect.set(target, key, value, receiver)
      if (result && oldValue != value) {
        trigger(target, key) // If this reactive property (target) has effects to rerun on SET, trigger them.
      }
      return result
    }
  }
  return new Proxy(target, handler)
}

// Walk through the codes
// 1. Our reactive function returns a proxy into our product object.
let product = reactive({ price: 5, quantity: 2 })
let total = 0

// 3. it will run track(product, 'price')
// 4. And inside the targetMap, it will create new mapping
// for product with the value of being a new depsMap
// and this will map the price property to a new dep,
// which is a set of effects,adding our total effect to the set.

// 5. Then we'll call product.quantity, which is another get request, we call the track(product, 'quantity')
//  This will access the dep map for our product, and map our quantity product, to a new dep set with our effect.
let effect = () => {
  total = product.price * product.quantity
}

// 2. When we here  try to get price
effect()

// 6. Then we'll print out our total to the console which is ten, 
console.log('before updated quantity total = ' + total)
// 7. Then we'll set quantity equal to 3. which we'll call trigger(product, 'quantity'), which then runs the stored effect.
product.quantity = 3
// 8. Then we run console.log(total) and it comes out to 15! 
console.log('after updated quantity total = ' + total)
```

Notice how we no longer need to call trigger and track because these are getting properly called inside our get and set methods. Running this code gives us:

before updated quantity total = 10

after updated quantity total = 15

Wow, we’ve come a long way! There’s only one bug to fix before this code is solid. Specifically, that we only want track to be called on a reactive object if it’s inside an effect. Right now track will be called whenever a reactive object property is get. We’ll polish this up in the next lesson.
