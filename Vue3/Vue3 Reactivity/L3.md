# [Vue 3 Reactivity](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/vue-3-reactivity/vue3-reactivity/)

## Lesson 3 activeEffect & ref

In this lesson we’ll continue to build out our reactivity code by fixing a small bug and then implementing reactive references, much like you might have seen in Vue 3. The bottom of our current code from the last lesson looks like this:

```javaScript
...
let product = reactive({ price: 5, quantity: 2 })
let total = 0

let effect = () => {
  total = product.price * product.quantity
}
effect()

console.log(total)

product.quantity = 3

console.log(total)
```

The problem arrives when we add code which GETs a property from our reactive object, like so:

```javaScript
console.log('Updated quantity to = ' + product.quantity)
```

The issue here is that track and all of it’s function will get called, even if we’re not inside an effect. We only want to look up and record the effect if get is called inside the active effect.

### Solution: activeEffect

To solve this problem, we’ll first create an activeEffect, a global variable we’ll store the currently running effect in. We’ll then set this inside a new function called effect.

```javaScript
let activeEffect = null // The active effect running
...
function effect(eff) {
  activeEffect = eff  // Set this as the activeEffect
  activeEffect()      // Run it
  activeEffect = null // Unset it
}

let product = reactive({ price: 5, quantity: 2 })
let total = 0

// 5
effect(() => {
  total = product.price * product.quantity
})

// We no longer need to call the effect. It's getting called we send our function in.
// 2.
effect(() => {
  salePrice = product.price * 0.9
})

console.log(
  `Before updated total (should be 10) = ${total} salePrice (should be 4.5) = ${salePrice}`
)

// 1. when we update the quantity, that's going to rerun the total at 2.
product.quantity = 3

// 3. Then it prints out the updated total, sale price is still the same.
console.log(
  `After updated total (should be 15) = ${total} salePrice (should be 4.5) = ${salePrice}`
)

// 4. When we set the price though, that should run both the above effects( 2 and 5)
product.price = 10

// 6. We see that total is now 30 and sale price is now 9
// Our code is working and now track is only gonna be run, when we have an active effect.
console.log(
  `After updated total (should be 30) = ${total} salePrice (should be 9) = ${salePrice}`
)
```

There’s one more change we need to make, and that’s inside the track function. It needs to use our new activeEffect.

```javaScript
function track(target, key) {
  if (activeEffect) { // <------ Check to see if we have an activeEffect
    let depsMap = targetMap.get(target)
    if (!depsMap) {
      targetMap.set(target, (depsMap = new Map())) 
    }
    let dep = depsMap.get(key) 
    if (!dep) {
      depsMap.set(key, (dep = new Set())) // Create a new Set
    }
    dep.add(activeEffect) // <----- Add activeEffect to dependency map
  }
}
```

now if we run our code we properly get:

```javaScript
Before updated total (should be 10) = 10 salePrice (should be 4.5) = 4.5
After updated total (should be 15) = 15 salePrice (should be 4.5) = 4.5
After updated total (should be 30) = 30 salePrice (should be 9) = 9
```

### The Need for Ref

When I was coding up this challenge I realized that the way I was calculating total might make a little more sense if it used the salePrice rather than price, like so:

```javaScript
effect(() => {
  total = salePrice * product.quantity
})
```

If we were creating a real store, we’d probably calculate the total based on the salePrice. However, this code wouldn’t work reactively. Specifically, when product.price is updated, it will reactively recalculate the salePrice with this effect:

```javaScript
effect(() => {
  salePrice = product.price * 0.9
})
```

But since salePrice isn’t reactive, the effect with total won’t get recalculated. Our first effect above won’t get re-run. We need some way to make salePrice reactive, and it’d be nice if we didn’t have to wrap it in another reactive object. If you’re familiar with the Composition API, which I teach in the Vue 3 Essentials Course, you might be thinking that I should use ref to create a Reactive Reference. Let’s do this:

```javaScript
let product = reactive({ price: 5, quantity: 2 })
let salePrice = ref(0)
let total = 0
```

According to the Vue documentation, __a reactive reference takes an inner value and returns a reactive and mutable ref object. The ref object has a single property .value that points to the inner value. So we’d need to change around our effects a little to use .value.__

```javaScript
effect(() => {
  salePrice.value = product.price * 0.9
})

effect(() => {
  total = salePrice.value * product.quantity
})
```

Our code should work now, properly updating the total when salePrice is updated. However, we still need to define ref. There’s two ways we could do it.

1. Defining Ref with Reactive

   First, we could simply use reactive as we’ve defined it:

   ```javaScript
    function ref(intialValue) {
      return reactive({ value: initialValue })
      }
   ```

However, this isn’t how Vue 3 defines ref with primitives, so let’s implement it differently.

### Understanding JavaScript Object Accessors (aka. computed properties)

In order to understand how Vue 3 defines ref, we first need to make sure we are familiar with object accessors. These are sometimes also known as JavaScript computed properties (not to be confused with Vue computed properties). Below you can see a simple example which uses Object Accessors:

```javaScript
let user = {
  firstName: 'Gregg',
  lastName: 'Pollack',

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  },

  set fullName(value) {
    [this.firstName, this.lastName] = value.split(' ')
  },
}

console.log(`Name is ${user.fullName}`)
user.fullName = 'Adam Jahr'
console.log(`Name is ${user.fullName}`)
```

The get and set lines are object accessors to get fullName and set fullName accordingly. This is plain JavaScript, and is not a feature of Vue.

2. Defining Ref with Object Accessors

Using Object Accessors, along with our track and trigger actions, we can now define ref using:

```javaScript
function ref(raw) {
  const r = {
    get value() {
      track(r, 'value')
      return raw
    },
    set value(newVal) {
      raw = newVal
      trigger(r, 'value')
    },
  }
  return r
}
```

That’s all there is to it. Now when we run the following code:

```javaScript
...
function ref(raw) {
  const r = {
    get value() {
      track(r, 'value')
      return raw
    },
    set value(newVal) {
      raw = newVal
      trigger(r, 'value')
    },
  }
  return r
}

function effect(eff) {
  activeEffect = eff
  activeEffect()
  activeEffect = null
}

let product = reactive({ price: 5, quantity: 2 })
let salePrice = ref(0)
let total = 0

effect(() => {
  salePrice.value = product.price * 0.9
})

effect(() => {
  total = salePrice.value * product.quantity
})

console.log(
  `Before updated quantity total (should be 9) = ${total} salePrice (should be 4.5) = ${salePrice.value}`
)
product.quantity = 3
console.log(
  `After updated quantity total (should be 13.5) = ${total} salePrice (should be 4.5) = ${salePrice.value}`
)
product.price = 10
console.log(
  `After updated price total (should be 27) = ${total} salePrice (should be 9) = ${salePrice.value}`
)
```

We get what we would expect:

```javaScript
Before updated total (should be 10) = 10 salePrice (should be 4.5) = 4.5
After updated total (should be 13.5) = 13.5 salePrice (should be 4.5) = 4.5
After updated total (should be 27) = 27 salePrice (should be 9) = 9
```

Our salePrice is now reactive and total gets updated when it changes!
