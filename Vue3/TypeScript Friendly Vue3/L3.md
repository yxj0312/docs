# Typing Your Callback Functions

Just like reactive variables, callback functions can also be easily inferred. In this lesson, we’ll explore the various ways to use functions in TypeScript with the help of type inference.

## Functions

Let’s add a button that triggers a function on click:

```javaScript
function addCount() {
  if (count.value !== null) {
    count.value += 1
  }
}

<template>
  ...
  <p>
    <button @click="addCount">Add</button>
  </p>
<template>
```

TypeScript won’t complain about this addCount function.

But what if we want to pass a number to the function as a parameter?

```javaScript
function addCount(num) {
  if (count.value !== null) {
    count.value += num
  }
}

<template>
  ...
  <p>
    <button @click="addCount(1)">Add</button>
  </p>
<template>
```

This situation is too ambiguous for type inference to guess what the type of this parameter should be, so TypeScript will use any as the type for num. Depending on your tsconfig.json, TypeScript might scream at you.

To improve the code, we simply need to annotate the parameter with its intended type:

```javaScript
function addCount(num: number) {
  if (count.value !== null) {
    count.value += num
  }
}
```

Now TypeScript is happy again.

## Type inference for function return

Notice that we’ve only been talking about the parameter type of a function. What about the return type of a function?

Function return is easily inferred by TypeScript.

For example, when we’re using computed:

```javaScript
const nextCount = computed(() => {
  if (count.value !== null) {
    return count.value + 1
  }
  return null
})
```

Since TypeScript knows that count.value is a number, a number + 1 is still just a number. Type inference is smart enough to figure that out by itself.

So there’s no need to manually specify the return type of the function.
