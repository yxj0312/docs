# Introduction to the Script Setup Syntax

While the evolution from Vue 3.1 to 3.2 was technically a minor version update, it comes with a major improvement in TypeScript experience. This new version of Vue promotes the Script Setup syntax, which was previously an experimental feature, and is now an officially supported one. With it, we have a simpler way to write components with the Composition API and a more elegant way of using TypeScript in our Vue apps.

```javaScript
// Composition API (original)
<script>
import { ref } from 'vue'

export default {
    setup() {
        const title = ref('Hello')
        return { title }
    }
}
</script>

// Composition API (with Script Setup)
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'

const title = ref('Hello')
</script>
```
