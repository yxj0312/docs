# Reactive Variables with Type Inference

In this lesson, we’ll start using TypeScript with ref() and reactive(). Type inference is a main theme when working with reactive variables. We’ll go through some general patterns and caveats on creating reactivie variables with/without type inference.

## Reactive variables (with type inference)

Inside the <script> tag, we can now use ref() directly as if we’re still inside the setup() function:

```javaScript
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } frpm 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

</script>

```

Everything about ref and reactive is still the same, including type inference.

The code that we have here looks just like plain old JavaScript because the type of this variable is inferred.

Type inference is a huge part of using TypeScript. It will guess the type of the variable by just looking at the value you pass into the ref function. So even if you don’t specify the variable’s type, your IDE will still be able to show you the type info when you put your cursor over the variable.

Just like ref(), we can still use reactive() the same way as in the original Composition API syntax:

```javaScript
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } frpm 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

const appInfo = reactive({
  name: 'Counter',
  slogan: 'an app you can count on'
})

</script>

```
