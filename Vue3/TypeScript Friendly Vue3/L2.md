# Reactive Variables with Type Inference

In this lesson, we’ll start using TypeScript with ref() and reactive(). Type inference is a main theme when working with reactive variables. We’ll go through some general patterns and caveats on creating reactivie variables with/without type inference.

## Reactive variables (with type inference)

Inside the <script> tag, we can now use ref() directly as if we’re still inside the setup() function:

```javaScript
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } frpm 'vue'

const count = ref(0)

</script>

```

Everything about ref and reactive is still the same, including type inference.

The code that we have here looks just like plain old JavaScript because the type of this variable is inferred.
