# Mocking Vuex Stores

At the end of this lesson, we’ll have learned how to:

1. Test complex components that rely on Vue and Vuex
2. Refactor our Vuex stores to be testable
3. Mock initial test state in Vuex
4. Re-use mock data from a fixture file such as db.json
5. Simplify our tests with reusable mount functions
6. Write complex tests using the “Setup ⇒ Find ⇒ Interact ⇒ Assert” framework
7. Use data-testid to rely on resilient, markup-agnostic selectors

## Introduction

Welcome back to the third lesson of Real World Testing. In this lesson, we’ll learn how to test components that depend on Vuex and Vue Router. At the end of this lesson, we’ll have learned how to mock dependencies like Vuex and Vue Router within our tests, organize our tests, using the setup, find, interact, and assert format and use the data test ID selector to target elements.

## Assessing the Application

Currently our events application contains one test for the EventCard component.

Last lesson, this component was refactored to be presentational, meaning it only focuses on displaying data rather than fetching the data itself or maintaining any of its own data. It is also decoupled from the applications Vuex and Vue Router plugs.

Now, we must also test the EventList to ensure that the entire list of our events is being rendered correctly.

## Mounting the EventList for the first time (Mock Vuex and Vue Router)

Let’s begin by looking at the code for EventList to review what we learned last lesson. Mounting the component is the hardest part of testing, and once we determine how to make a component testable, writing the assertions is easy.

The first step is to list out the environmental dependencies and public API.

1. The event list depends on Vuex and Vue Router
2. Note that there are no props passed in.

This means we need to mock out the methods the component depends on to get it to render. All of this work must be done before we are able to mount our component at all.

Ideally, we would make EventList testable by passing the state in as an initial test-only property. Sometimes, especially in complex applications, this is not possible without a lot of work. In this course, we focus on testing real-world applications. And so at this point we won’t be refactoring our component to make it more testable.

Instead we’ll focus on testing the component as it is. The first step when testing a new component is to create a new file, a describe block, an it block, and an assertion.
