## What should we be testing?

### Make decisions based on 2 factors

1. How critical is the component's code?

   So what is the most critical feature that needs to work? This website’s primary job is to present information about what the Events for Good in both the Event’s list and detail view. It also supports the creation of new events. Both features are important.

2. How easy is it to write the component's test?

    Components that have few dependencies and are self-contained without side-effects will be very easy to test.

    However, if the component has many dependencies, such as Vuex, Vue Router, or Axios, then it will be very difficult to test. If testing the component becomes very difficult, then you may not need to component-test it. Instead, you can achieve code coverage for that part of the code by way of end-to-end or integration testing. We will not cover end-to-end tests in this course, but once we implement the component tests, you will understand why end-to-end tests may be more appropriate for complex page-level components.
