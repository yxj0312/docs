# Slots: Fundamentals

## Introduction

When you need to take your components to the next level beyond props, the use of slots is the next technique to enhance your components. In this lesson, we will be taking a look at essential knowledge to be successful with slots.

With the BaseButton component we discussed in the previous lesson, we can take a configuration heavy component into a flexible component using the same HTML element model that any HTML developer will intuitively underst

App.vue with BaseButton using props

```javaScript
<template>
  <main>
    <BaseButton text="Cancel" />
    <BaseButton text="Submit" right-icon="right-arrow" />
  </main>
</template>
```

App.vue with BaseButton using slots

```javaScript
<template>
  <main>
    <BaseButton>Cancel</BaseButton>
    <BaseButton>Submit <span class="icon right-arrow"></span></BaseButton>
  </main>
</template>
```
