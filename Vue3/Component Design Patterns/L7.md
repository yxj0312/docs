# Scoped Slots: Part 1

## Introduction

Slots allow developers to have the flexibility to provide content to a child component, but what happens when the child component has control of the data? In these cases, scoped slots are here to come to the rescue.

## What are scoped slots?

Scoped slots is a technique for allowing a component to expose data to the slotâ€™s template block. While that may sound like a mouthful, if we take the analogy of a crane game, slots allow us to put data into it from the parent.

However, when we want to access data from the child, standard slots will not give us permission to grab that data. As a result, we need to expose the data from the child so that we can grab it and put it in the slot as desired.

In terms of code, letâ€™s take a look at a Library.vue and Book.vue example:

ðŸ“„Book.vue

```javaScript
<template>
  <div class="book">
    <slot name="title"></slot>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      bookTitle: 'Child Providing Data'
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

ðŸ“„Library.vue

```javaScript
<template>
  <Book>
    <template v-slot:title>
      <!-- How do we get the bookTitle from Book.vue? -->
    </template>
  </Book>
</template>
```

As we can see in the code example, the data is currently embedded in our Book.vue component and we need to some how render it in the Library.vue component. Letâ€™s learn how we can use scoped slots!
