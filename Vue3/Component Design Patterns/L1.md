# 2. [Props: Fundamentals](https://www.vuemastery.com/courses/component-design-Patterns/props-fundamentals)

## Introduction

When it comes to passing information down from one component to another, props are the first technique that most Vue developers encounter. By defining a props property on a component, it can then receive data.

```javaScript
<MoviePoster
    image="hero.png"
    title="Framework"
    length="54:43"
    watched="true"
/>

<script>
export default {
    props: ['image', 'title', 'length', 'watched']
}
</script>

<template>
    <section>
        <img :src="image" />
        <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
        <p>{{length}}</p>
        <span v-if="watched">checked</span>
    </section>
</template>
```

## Defining Props: Best Practices

When defining props, many developers are initially exposed to the Array syntax.

```javaScript
<MoviePoster
    image="hero.png"
    title="Framework"
    length="54:43"
    watched="true"
/>

<script>
export default {
    name: 'Movie',
    props: [ 'image', 'title', 'length', 'watched']
}
</script>

<template>
    <section>
        <img :src="image" />
        <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
        <p>{{length}}</p>
        <span v-if="watched">checked</span>
    </section>
</template>
```

While there is nothing wrong with this definition and will work in production, there are some pitfalls that exists with this method:

- Although the prop names may seem intuitive based on its meaning, it leaves it open for interpretation which can often lead to bugs
- For example, what happens when a developer forgets to include a prop that is technically required for the component to render properly? A Movie component without a title would look rather silly wouldn’t it?
- Another issue that arises is that the definition of each prop is vague. In the example we have above, should length be a number? Should it be a formatted string (i.e., 1:28)? But then which format should it be (i.e., 1 hr 28 min)
- And when registering whether the movie has been watched before, what’s the proper way to tell it’s been watched (e.g., Yes? Y? Watched? true?)

### The Problems

1. How do we make the data consistent?
2. What if someone forgets a critical prop?
3. Do we need to pass every prop every time?
