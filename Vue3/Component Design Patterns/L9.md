# One Object to Rule Them All

## Introduction

One of the first things that Vue developers often learn is the magic of using v-bind and v-on to supercharge their HTML with dynamic bindings and event listeners. The declarative nature of v-bind and v-on make it very easy for other developers to follow.

```javaScript
<input 
  :id="inputId" 
  :data-tooltip="tooltipText"
  @change="updateForm" 
  @mouseover="showTooltip"
/>
```

However, as components grow larger and complex, we can find that this approach becomes limiting and can even create confusion. When it comes to this point, it’s time to learn a hidden secret that most Vue developers don’t know about till much later in their journey: you can dynamically define multiple values for v-bind and v-on.

## v-bind with No Argument

As I mentioned earlier, most Vue developers are familiar with the following syntax:

```javaScript
<template>
  <img v-bind:src="imageAttrs.source" v-bind:alt="imageAttrs.text" />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      imageAttrs: {
        src: '/vue-mastery-logo.png',
        text: 'Vue Mastery Logo'
      }
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

What many don’t realize is that this syntax is the href part of our v-bind statement is actually an argument. In other words, by passing in an argument to v-bind, we are telling Vue that we want to bind a specific property to this particular attribute.

However, what’s even more perplexing is that this argument is optional. What does this mean? Well, believe it or not, our code can actually be written instead as:

```javaScript
<img v-bind="{ src: imageAttrs.source, alt: imageAttrs.text }" />
```

This could then be abstracted one step further to:

```javaScript
<img v-bind="imageAttrs" />
```

However, while this this is very short and concise, most of us would still prefer the original way of declaring attributes due to its clarity and ease of use.

## v-on with No Arguments

When it comes to v-on, most people are familiar with the following usage:

```javaScript
<template>
  <img v-on:click="openGallery" v-on:mouseover="showTooltip" />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  methods: {
    openGallery() { ... },
    showTooltip() { ... }
  }
}
</script>
```

Just like v-bind, the event name we define is actually an argument being passed to v-on. As a result, we can also rewrite our input element as:

```javaScript
<template>
  <img v-on="{ click: openGallery, mouseover: showTooltip }" />
</template>
```

And theoretically, we could abstract this one step further to:

```javaScript
<template>
  <img v-on="inputEvents" />
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    inputEvents: {
      click: this.openGallery,
      mouseover: this.showTooltip
    }
  },
  methods: {
    openGallery() { ... },
    showTooltip() { ... }
  }
}
</script>
```

However, just like we mentioned earlier in the v-bind section, most of us would still prefer the original syntax because it is easy to understand and change if necessary.
