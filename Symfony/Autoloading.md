If your Symfony project is throwing errors about non-existing object values, it's likely related to the autoloading or the structure of your project. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and fix the issue:

1. **Check Autoloading:**
   - Ensure that your classes are correctly autoloaded. Symfony relies on Composer's autoloader. Run the following command in your project root to regenerate the autoloader:

     ```bash
     composer dump-autoload
     ```

2. **Namespace and Class Names:**
   - Verify that the namespaces and class names in your project are correct and consistent. Make sure that the namespaces in your classes match the actual directory structure.

3. **Clear Symfony Cache:**
   - Symfony uses a cache to optimize performance. Clear the cache to make sure any changes are reflected:

     ```bash
     php bin/console cache:clear
     ```

4. **Check for Typos:**
   - Carefully review your code and configuration files for typos, especially in entity annotations, YAML, or XML files.

5. **Composer Update:**
   - Ensure that your `composer.json` file and dependencies are up to date. Run:

     ```bash
     composer update
     ```

6. **Verify Database Connection:**
   - If your project involves a database, make sure the database connection is correctly configured. Check the `DATABASE_URL` parameter in your `.env` file.

7. **Check for Missing Classes:**
   - If Symfony is complaining about missing classes, ensure that the necessary classes are defined and correctly namespaced. Use the `php bin/console debug:autowiring` command to check for any missing services or classes.

     ```bash
     php bin/console debug:autowiring
     ```

8. **Review Symfony Logs:**
   - Check the Symfony logs (`var/logs/dev.log` or `var/logs/prod.log`) for more detailed error messages. These logs can provide insights into the specific issues.

9. **Debugging Tools:**
   - Utilize Symfony's built-in debugging tools. For example, you can enable the Symfony Profiler by ensuring the `framework.profiler` configuration is set to `true` in `config/packages/dev/framework.yaml`.

10. **Revisit Changes:**
   - If the issue started after making changes, carefully review those changes. Sometimes, a recent modification might be the source of the problem.

11. **Check for PHP Version Compatibility:**
   - Ensure that your Symfony version is compatible with the PHP version you are using. Check Symfony's official documentation for compatibility information.
