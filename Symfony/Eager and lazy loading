**Eager Loading and Lazy Loading:**

**Eager Loading:**
- Eager loading is the strategy of loading related data along with the main data when querying the database.
- It aims to reduce the number of queries by fetching all necessary data in one go.
- In the context of object-relational mapping (ORM) frameworks like Symfony's Doctrine, eager loading often involves fetching associations or relationships when querying for entities.

**Lazy Loading:**
- Lazy loading, on the other hand, is a technique where related data is not loaded until it is specifically requested.
- In the context of Doctrine, this means that associated entities are not fetched from the database until you try to access them.

**How to Use Them in Symfony with Doctrine:**

**Eager Loading in Symfony:**
- In Symfony with Doctrine, eager loading is often achieved using the `fetch` attribute in entity associations.
- Example:

```php
// AppBundle/Entity/Product.php

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Category", fetch="EAGER")
     * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="category_id", referencedColumnName="id")
     */
    private $category;

    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `category` association will be eagerly loaded when querying for `Product` entities.

**Lazy Loading in Symfony:**
- Lazy loading is the default behavior for associations in Doctrine.
- You can also explicitly set it, though it's not necessary, as it's the default.

```php
// AppBundle/Entity/Product.php

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Category")
     * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="category_id", referencedColumnName="id")
     */
    private $category;

    // ...
}
```

In this case, `category` association will be lazily loaded, meaning it won't be fetched from the database until you access the `category` property.

**When to Use:**
- Use eager loading when you know you will definitely need the associated data and want to minimize additional queries.
- Use lazy loading when the associated data is not always needed, especially if fetching it may be expensive in terms of performance.

It's crucial to balance eager and lazy loading based on your application's requirements and performance considerations.
