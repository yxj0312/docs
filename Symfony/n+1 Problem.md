The N+1 problem is a performance issue that occurs when fetching a collection of entities along with their related entities, resulting in a large number of database queries. The name "N+1" comes from the number of queries needed to fetch a collection of N entities along with their associations.

Here's a typical scenario:

1. You fetch a collection of entities (e.g., a list of products).
2. For each entity in the collection, you also want to fetch related entities (e.g., the category of each product).
3. Without proper optimization, this can lead to N additional queries for fetching the related entities, resulting in N+1 queries.

This problem is common when using lazy loading for associations because each related entity is loaded individually when accessed, causing additional queries.

**Example:**

Consider a scenario with `Product` entities and each product has a `Category` association.

```php
// AppBundle/Entity/Product.php

use Doctrine\ORM\Mapping as ORM;

/**
 * @ORM\Entity
 */
class Product
{
    // ...

    /**
     * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Category")
     * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="category_id", referencedColumnName="id")
     */
    private $category;

    // ...
}
```

Now, let's say you want to fetch a list of products along with their categories:

```php
// Controller or Service
$products = $entityManager->getRepository(Product::class)->findAll();

foreach ($products as $product) {
    // Each access to $product->getCategory() triggers a separate query.
    $category = $product->getCategory();
    // ...
}
```

In the above code, for every product in the loop, an additional query is executed to fetch its associated category. If you have N products, this results in N+1 queries.

**Preventing N+1 Problem:**

1. **Eager Loading:**
   - Use eager loading to fetch the related entities along with the main entities in a single query.
   - Modify the entity mapping to fetch associations eagerly.

   ```php
   // AppBundle/Entity/Product.php

   /**
    * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Category", fetch="EAGER")
    * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="category_id", referencedColumnName="id")
    */
   private $category;
   ```

2. **Join Fetch:**
   - Use join fetch in Doctrine queries to explicitly instruct Doctrine to fetch associations eagerly for a specific query.

   ```php
   // Example DQL query with join fetch
   $query = $entityManager->createQuery('
       SELECT p, c
       FROM AppBundle\Entity\Product p
       JOIN FETCH p.category c
   ');

   $products = $query->getResult();
   ```

3. **Batch Fetching:**
   - Use batch fetching if the number of related entities is large. This involves configuring Doctrine to fetch related entities in batches.

   ```php
   // AppBundle/Entity/Product.php

   /**
    * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Category", fetch="BATCH")
    * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="category_id", referencedColumnName="id")
    */
   private $category;
   ```

Choose the approach based on your specific use case and performance requirements. It's important to balance eager and lazy loading strategies to optimize performance in different scenarios.
