In Symfony with Doctrine, efficiently fetching collections of entities along with their related entities often involves a combination of strategies, including:

1. **Eager Loading:**
   - Use eager loading to fetch associations along with the main entities in a single query. This can be done using the `fetch="EAGER"` attribute in the entity mapping.
   - Example:

   ```php
   // AppBundle/Entity/Product.php

   /**
    * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Category", fetch="EAGER")
    * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="category_id", referencedColumnName="id")
    */
   private $category;
   ```

2. **Join Fetch in Queries:**
   - Use `JOIN FETCH` in Doctrine queries to explicitly instruct Doctrine to fetch associations eagerly for a specific query.
   - Example:

   ```php
   // Example DQL query with join fetch
   $query = $entityManager->createQuery('
       SELECT p, c
       FROM AppBundle\Entity\Product p
       JOIN FETCH p.category c
   ');

   $products = $query->getResult();
   ```

3. **Batch Fetching:**
   - Use batch fetching for associations that result in a large number of related entities. This involves configuring Doctrine to fetch related entities in batches.
   - Example:

   ```php
   // AppBundle/Entity/Product.php

   /**
    * @ORM\ManyToOne(targetEntity="Category", fetch="BATCH")
    * @ORM\JoinColumn(name="category_id", referencedColumnName="id")
    */
   private $category;
   ```

   This tells Doctrine to use batch fetching for the `category` association.

4. **Hydration Mode:**
   - Choose the appropriate hydration mode based on your needs. Doctrine supports different hydration modes, including `HYDRATE_OBJECT` and `HYDRATE_ARRAY`.
   - Example:

   ```php
   // Example query with HYDRATE_ARRAY
   $query = $entityManager->createQuery('
       SELECT p, c
       FROM AppBundle\Entity\Product p
       JOIN p.category c
   ');

   $products = $query->getResult(\Doctrine\ORM\Query::HYDRATE_ARRAY);
   ```

   Using `HYDRATE_ARRAY` will return results as associative arrays.

Remember that the best strategy may vary based on your specific use case, the number of entities involved, and the performance requirements of your application. It's often a good practice to use a combination of these strategies and to profile and optimize your queries as needed. Always monitor the number of queries executed and their impact on performance.
