For a complex approval process like the one you described, you might benefit from using the State Machine pattern to model the various stages the application goes through. Symfony provides a component called `workflow` that enables you to implement state machines easily.

Here's a general outline of how you can structure your Symfony application using the State Machine pattern:

1. **Define States:**
   - Identify the different stages or states your application can be in (e.g., "Pending", "Nationality Check", "Background Check", "Approved", "Rejected").

2. **Define Transitions:**
   - Identify the actions or events that trigger a transition from one state to another (e.g., "Submit Application", "Pass Nationality Check", "Fail Background Check", "Approve", "Reject").

3. **Implement the State Machine in Symfony:**
   - Use the Symfony `workflow` component to define your state machine. This involves creating a workflow configuration, defining transitions, and integrating it into your application.

4. **Integration with Symfony Entities:**
   - Apply the state machine to your Symfony entities (e.g., `Application` entity). You can use annotations or YAML configuration to map states and transitions to your entity properties.

Now, let's go through a simplified example using Symfony's `workflow` component:

```php
// src/Entity/Application.php
namespace App\Entity;

use Symfony\Component\Workflow\Annotation as Workflow;

/**
 * @Workflow\Workflow(
 *     name="application_workflow",
 *     type="state_machine",
 *     initialPlaces={"pending"},
 *     places={"nationality_check", "background_check", "approved", "rejected"}
 * )
 */
class Application
{
    /**
     * @Workflow\Marking
     */
    private $status;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->status = 'pending';
    }

    // Getter and setter for status

    public function getStatus(): string
    {
        return $this->status;
    }

    public function setStatus(string $status): void
    {
        $this->status = $status;
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Application` entity is annotated with the Symfony `workflow` component. It defines the possible states (places) and transitions between them. The initial state is set to "pending". You can expand on this by adding methods for each transition event.

Now, in your controller or service, you can use the `workflow` component to transition between states based on different events:

```php
// src/Controller/ApplicationController.php
namespace App\Controller;

use App\Entity\Application;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class ApplicationController extends AbstractController
{
    #[Route('/submit-application', name: 'submit_application')]
    public function submitApplication(): Response
    {
        $application = new Application();
        // ... perform any other setup for the application

        // Transition to the next state (e.g., "Nationality Check")
        $workflow = $this->get('workflow.application_workflow');
        $workflow->apply($application, 'submit');

        // Save the updated application entity to the database

        return $this->redirectToRoute('application_details', ['id' => $application->getId()]);
    }

    #[Route('/application-details/{id}', name: 'application_details')]
    public function applicationDetails(Application $application): Response
    {
        // ... render application details based on its current state

        return $this->render('application/details.html.twig', ['application' => $application]);
    }
}
```

In this example, when an application is submitted, it transitions to the next state ("Nationality Check"). You can follow a similar pattern for other transitions like background checks, approval, or rejection.

This approach allows you to easily model and implement complex approval processes, providing a clear structure and separation of concerns. Additionally, Symfony's `workflow` component offers features like guards, enabling you to implement conditional transitions based on specific criteria.
For a non-linear process where multiple checks can be performed in any order, you can use the Workflow pattern with the Symfony `workflow` component, but this time as a "workflow" rather than a "state machine." A workflow allows for transitions between multiple states based on different events. In your case, each check can be considered an event.

Let's create a Symfony example for an application that can go through different checks in any order:

```php
// src/Entity/Application.php
namespace App\Entity;

use Symfony\Component\Workflow\Annotation as Workflow;

/**
 * @Workflow\Workflow(
 *     name="application_workflow",
 *     type="workflow",
 *     initialPlace="pending",
 *     places={"nationality_check", "background_check", "approval", "rejection"}
 * )
 */
class Application
{
    /**
     * @Workflow\Marking
     */
    private $status;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->status = 'pending';
    }

    // Getter and setter for status

    public function getStatus(): string
    {
        return $this->status;
    }

    public function setStatus(string $status): void
    {
        $this->status = $status;
    }
}
```

In this example, we have places representing different checks, and the workflow is configured to be of type "workflow," allowing for non-linear transitions.

Now, let's create a Symfony controller to handle the transitions:

```php
// src/Controller/ApplicationController.php
namespace App\Controller;

use App\Entity\Application;
use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Controller\AbstractController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class ApplicationController extends AbstractController
{
    #[Route('/submit-application', name: 'submit_application')]
    public function submitApplication(): Response
    {
        $application = new Application();
        // ... perform any other setup for the application

        // Transition to different states (checks) in any order
        $workflow = $this->get('workflow.application_workflow');

        // Perform nationality check
        $workflow->apply($application, 'nationality_check');

        // Perform background check
        $workflow->apply($application, 'background_check');

        // Perform approval
        $workflow->apply($application, 'approval');

        // Save the updated application entity to the database

        return $this->redirectToRoute('application_details', ['id' => $application->getId()]);
    }

    #[Route('/application-details/{id}', name: 'application_details')]
    public function applicationDetails(Application $application): Response
    {
        // ... render application details based on its current state

        return $this->render('application/details.html.twig', ['application' => $application]);
    }
}
```

In this example, we use the `apply` method of the Symfony `workflow` component to transition the application between different states (checks) in any order. The events ('nationality_check', 'background_check', 'approval') act as the triggers for these transitions.

The `Application` entity can now represent an application going through multiple checks in a non-linear fashion. You can extend this example by creating methods for different checks and triggering them based on user interactions or other criteria.

This approach allows for flexibility in managing the approval process without enforcing a strict linear sequence of checks.
