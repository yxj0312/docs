# Intro to GraphQL

There’s a problem with using traditional REST APIs: we always get the same server response for a given endpoint.

This lack of flexibility can lead to two equally annoying issues:

1. Over-fetching data — when we get a huge response but only need a small piece of it.
2. Under-fetching — when we perform the first call only to receive a small piece of what we need. This can lead to chaining API calls and fetching even more unnecessary data in an attempt to get what we need.
Wouldn’t it be great instead if we could shape the response we get with the request we make, and fetch only what we need, when we need it? Fortunately that is possible with GraphQL, a modern way to build and query APIs.

In Vue Mastery’s GraphQL course, we will be creating a Vue + GraphQL app together to gain the confidence of using this powerful, modern tool.
